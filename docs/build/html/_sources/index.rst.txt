Data Reduction documentation
============================

This package is created to faciliate the data reduction process of the data from the vienna little telescope (vlt) and the `Leopold Figl-Observatory for astrophysik <https://foa.univie.ac.at>`_ (LFOA).

The whole code is heavily under development and will very possibly change and/or be extended over time. Despite testing as much as possible there might still be a couple of bugs or unintentional behavior.

Motivation
**********
This project originated from a simple program for a practical session during my bachelor study. In each subsequent practical course the inital program got reworked and extended to provide a more general usege of the program.
